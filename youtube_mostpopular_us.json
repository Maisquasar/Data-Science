        "description": "The final #WickedForGood trailer is here ✨ Watch now.\n\nPre-order Wicked: For Good - The Soundtrack 💚🩷 available November 21st at https://wickedthesoundtrack.lnk.to/forgood\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: https://wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend …\n\nLast year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time.

          "description": "The final #WickedForGood trailer is here ✨ Watch now.\n\nPre-order Wicked: For Good - The Soundtrack 💚🩷 available November 21st at https://wickedthesoundtrack.lnk.to/forgood\n-----\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@wickedmovie\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/wickedmovie\nX: https://twitter.com/wickedmovie\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wickedmovie\nOfficial Site: https://wickedmovie.com\n\nAnd now whatever way our stories end, I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend …\n\nLast year’s global cinematic cultural sensation, which became the most successful Broadway film adaptation of all time, now reaches its epic, electrifying, emotional conclusion in Wicked: For Good. \n\nDirected once again by award-winning director Jon M. Chu and starring the spectacular returning cast, led by Academy Award® nominated superstars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, the final chapter of the untold story of the witches of Oz begins with Elphaba and Glinda estranged and living with the consequences of their choices. \n\nElphaba (Cynthia Erivo), now demonized as The Wicked Witch of the West, lives in exile, hidden within the Ozian forest while continuing her fight for the freedom of Oz’s silenced Animals and desperately trying to expose the truth she knows about The Wizard (Jeff Goldblum).  \n\nGlinda, meanwhile, has become the glamorous symbol of Goodness for all of Oz, living at the palace in Emerald City and reveling in the perks of fame and popularity. Under the instruction of Madame Morrible (Oscar® winner Michelle Yeoh), Glinda is deployed to serve as an effervescent comfort to Oz, reassuring the masses that all is well under the rule of The Wizard.  \n\nAs Glinda’s stardom expands and she prepares to marry Prince Fiyero (Olivier award winner and Emmy and SAG nominee Jonathan Bailey) in a spectacular Ozian wedding, she is haunted by her separation from Elphaba. She attempts to broker a conciliation between Elphaba and The Wizard, but those efforts will fail, driving Elphaba and Glinda only further apart. The aftershocks will transform Boq (Tony nominee Ethan Slater) and Fiyero forever, and threaten the safety of Elphaba’s sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode), when a girl from Kansas comes crashing into all their lives. \n\nAs an angry mob rises against the Wicked Witch, Glinda and Elphaba will need to come together one final time. With their singular friendship now the fulcrum of their futures, they will need to truly see each other, with honesty and empathy, if they are to change themselves, and all of Oz, for good. \n\nWicked: For Good also stars Emmy nominee Bowen Yang and Bronwyn James as Glinda’s fawning assistants, Pfannee and ShenShen and BAFTA and Grammy nominee Sharon D. Clarke (Caroline, or Change) as the voice of Elphaba’s childhood nanny, Dulcibear. \n\nThe film is produced by returning Tony and Emmy winning powerhouse Marc Platt p.g.a. and by multiple Tony winner David Stone.

This is the Search for Minecraft's Lost Empire. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video:  \u202a@TheobaldTheBird @wemmbumc  @dragon_mc_ \u202a@MapiccMc  \u202a@loppezz  HerobaneNair \u202a@TheSorta1  Horace Zeraph \u202a@boomiee @JadenMAN I definitely missed a few names I'm so sorry, there were so many of you LOL\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms!

          "description": "Millions of blocks out on the Unstable SMP, exists the Great Sea... a vast expanse of ocean that's rumored to contain some sort of lost treasure. This is the Search for Minecraft's Lost Empire. \n\nLike ParrotX2 and his Unstable SMP series, where he is escaping Paragon / Proton: Minecraft's Most Secure Prison, or got hunted by a Minecraft Player who doesn't exist. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or Lifesteal with Wemmbu, FlameFrags, or Spoke. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on.\n\nPeople in this video:  \u202a@TheobaldTheBird @wemmbumc  @dragon_mc_ \u202a@MapiccMc  \u202a@loppezz  HerobaneNair \u202a@TheSorta1  Horace Zeraph \u202a@boomiee @JadenMAN I definitely missed a few names I'm so sorry, there were so many of you LOL\n\nThis is a video on the Unstable Universe: a staged Minecraft server where ParrotX2, Wemmbu, Spoke, and FlameFrags tell stories in Minecraft.\n\nA Minecraft video made by Parrot or ParrotX2 on other platforms! Enjoy!"

ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n\n#Roblox #foltyn",

A bold, iconoclastic take on one of the world’s most compelling stories.\n\nA lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travels to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (five-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman and The Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!\n\nThe film stars Buckley, Bale, Peter Sarsgaard, with Bening, Academy Award nominee Jake Gyllenhaal, and Oscar winner Penélope Cruz. Maggie Gyllenhaal directs from her own screenplay and produces alongside Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Talia Kleinhendler and Osnat Handelsman Keren. The executive producers are Carla Raij, David Webb and Courtney Kivowitz. \n\nGyllenhaal is supported behind the camera by a team of award-winning film artisans, including director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Karen Murphy, editor Dylan Tichenor, music supervisor Randall Poster, composer Hildur Gudnadóttir and costume designer Sandy Powell. \n\nWarner Bros.

        "description": "FINALLY!! Marvel's Wolverine Trailer Reaction! Marvel’s Wolverine Gameplay Trailer Reaction, Recap, Commentary, & Breakdown!!\nMarvel Zombies Reaction https://youtu.be/qdf-nMF5FTc\nFantastic Four First Steps Movie Reaction: https://youtu.be/6rGQg7k5hVs\nGen V Season 2 Episode 4 Reaction: https://youtu.be/GnoqYVurmWc\nDeadpool & Wolverine Movie Reaction: https://youtu.be/WGr3viJJJK0\nGreg Alba & Aaron Alexander break down the newly dropped Marvel’s Wolverine gameplay trailer from Sony’s State of Play. Developed by Insomniac Games (the studio behind Marvel’s Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2), this action-adventure PS5 exclusive is scheduled for Fall 2026. The trailer teases brutal, bloody claw combat, visceral animations, rage meter mechanics, and Wolverine pushing through his haunted past to uncover a larger mystery.\nStory & tone: Logan (Wolverine) is digging into his past, facing internal rage and external enemies. Expect darker, mature storytelling and grotesque violence.\nConfirmed characters / mythos:\n • Wolverine / James “Logan” Howlett – main playable hero.\n • Mystique – confirmed for the cast.\n • Omega Red – one of the villains listed.\nBecause Insomniac’s Wolverine sits in the same world as their Spider-Man games, there’s speculation of potential crossover, Easter eggs, or shared lore threads with upcoming MCU projects like Avengers: Doomsday and the future X-Men reboot.\nIf you love Wolverine, mature Marvel games, or are excited for a darker, visceral take from Insomniac (post-Spider-Man), this video is for you. Join us as we theorize possible villain rosters, connections to the MCU, and what this means for Avengers: Doomsday, X-Men, and more.\n#MarvelsWolverine #Wolverine #WolverineGameplay #StateOfPlay #Spiderman #InsomniacGames #MarvelGameReaction #marvelgames  #XMen #Avengers #Marvel #MarvelVideoGames #GameReaction #FirstImpressions \n\n\n\nIntense Suspense by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSupport The Channel By Getting Some REEL REJECTS Aparrel! https://www.rejectnationshop.com/\n\nRR Clips & Shorts Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ReelRejectsClips\n\nFollow TheReelRejects On The Socials: \nIG: https://www.instagram.com/reelrejects/\nTT: https://www.tiktok.com/@thereelrejects?lang=en\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thereelrejects\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/TheReelRejects/\n\nMusic Used In Ad: \nHat the Jazz by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nHappy Alley by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nHead Editor: https://www.instagram.com/praperhq/?hl=en\nSupervising Producer: https://twitter.com/nerdchronic?lang=en\nCo-Editor: Greg Alba\nCo-Editor: John Humphrey\n\nMusic In Video: Airport Lounge - Disco Ultralounge by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nFollow & Listen to Us Wherever You Get Your Podcasts!!\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3XHMwbveiznxSOGxN9XT0M\n- Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vc3Rhci13YXJzLXRhbGs\n- Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-reel-rejects-tv-movie-recaps/id1616339990\n- Audible: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Apocalypse-Podcast/B08JJP58FG\n\nAsk Us A QUESTION On CAMEO: https://www.cameo.com/thereelrejects\n\nFollow GREG On INSTAGRAM & TWITTER:\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thegregalba/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thegregalba\n\n\nPLAYLISTS:\n\nTrailer Reactions & Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw9ZsLdoAQFpx38s2hhyFgDe\n\nMovie Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw-comtadVs8b9JsZEWHUyr8\n\nMovie Talk (News, Spoiler Reviews, & Film Rumors!!!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw8fPQ-21NVSb2IOwIiHbVt8\n\n\nYoutube Video Reactions & Discussions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw_qwcPsN_vOxXC6IVzrOQYG\n\nSketches & Short Films:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw_zWuTRfBOUP3aYyIYRzc2y",

Developed by Insomniac Games (the studio behind Marvel’s Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2), this action-adventure PS5 exclusive is scheduled for Fall 2026. The trailer teases brutal, bloody claw combat, visceral animations, rage meter mechanics, and Wolverine pushing through his haunted past to uncover a larger mystery.\nStory & tone: Logan (Wolverine) is digging into his past, facing internal rage and external enemies. Expect darker, mature storytelling and grotesque violence.\nConfirmed characters / mythos:\n • Wolverine / James “Logan” Howlett – main playable hero.\n • Mystique – confirmed for the cast.\n • Omega Red – one of the villains listed.\nBecause Insomniac’s Wolverine sits in the same world as their Spider-Man games, there’s speculation of potential crossover, Easter eggs, or shared lore threads with upcoming MCU projects like Avengers: Doomsday and the future X-Men reboot.\nIf you love Wolverine, mature Marvel games, or are excited for a darker, visceral take from Insomniac (post-Spider-Man), this video is for you. Join us as we theorize possible villain rosters, connections to the MCU, and what this means for Avengers: Doomsday, X-Men, and more.\n#MarvelsWolverine #Wolverine #WolverineGameplay #StateOfPlay #Spiderman #InsomniacGames #MarvelGameReaction #marvelgames  #XMen #Avengers #Marvel #MarvelVideoGames #GameReaction #FirstImpressions \n\n\n\nIntense Suspense by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nSupport The Channel By Getting Some REEL REJECTS Aparrel! https://www.rejectnationshop.com/\n\nRR Clips & Shorts Channel: https://www.youtube.com/@ReelRejectsClips\n\nFollow TheReelRejects On The Socials: \nIG: https://www.instagram.com/reelrejects/\nTT: https://www.tiktok.com/@thereelrejects?lang=en\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thereelrejects\nFB: https://www.facebook.com/TheReelRejects/\n\nMusic Used In Ad: \nHat the Jazz by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nHappy Alley by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nHead Editor: https://www.instagram.com/praperhq/?hl=en\nSupervising Producer: https://twitter.com/nerdchronic?lang=en\nCo-Editor: Greg Alba\nCo-Editor: John Humphrey\n\nMusic In Video: Airport Lounge - Disco Ultralounge by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nFollow & Listen to Us Wherever You Get Your Podcasts!!\n- Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/3XHMwbveiznxSOGxN9XT0M\n- Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vc3Rhci13YXJzLXRhbGs\n- Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-reel-rejects-tv-movie-recaps/id1616339990\n- Audible: https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Apocalypse-Podcast/B08JJP58FG\n\nAsk Us A QUESTION On CAMEO: https://www.cameo.com/thereelrejects\n\nFollow GREG On INSTAGRAM & TWITTER:\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/thegregalba/\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/thegregalba\n\n\nPLAYLISTS:\n\nTrailer Reactions & Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw9ZsLdoAQFpx38s2hhyFgDe\n\nMovie Reviews:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw-comtadVs8b9JsZEWHUyr8\n\nMovie Talk (News, Spoiler Reviews, & Film Rumors!!!):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw8fPQ-21NVSb2IOwIiHbVt8\n\n\nYoutube Video Reactions & Discussions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw_qwcPsN_vOxXC6IVzrOQYG\n\nSketches & Short Films:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-bIhJVeYWw_zWuTRfBOUP3aYyIYRzc2y"
